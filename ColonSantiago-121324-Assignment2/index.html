      <h1>Republican Party Continues to Gain Ground in New York City</h1>
      <h2>Electoral districts in communities such as Washington Heights saw a significant increase in support for the Republican sector</h2>
      <h3>By Leyrian Colón Santiago</h3>

        Danny Hernández, a Latino born in New York City with Dominican heritage, who prior to the recent elections identified as a Democrat,
        acknowledges that voting for Trump may bring financial relief to the city. He believes that New York is facing its worst economic crisis in years,
        largely due to the influx of immigrants into the area.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hernández, who lives with his mother in Washington Heights, also expressed concerns about the safety of senior citizens in Upper Manhattan's communities.
        <br>
        <br>
       "The increase in immigrants in the community affects businesses and our quality of life because we are constantly on alert.
        This causes stress, and we can't live like this," said the 53-year-old Hernández.
        <br>
        <br>
        According to an analysis by the New York City News Service, seven electoral districts in Washington Heights
        saw a significant decrease in votes for the Democratic Party,
        while support for the Republican Party increased in this area of Upper Manhattan.

        These data reflect the growing erosion of Democratic support in New York City, which led to Vice President Kamala Harris
        winning by only 37 points over Trump—much narrower than the margin in the 2020 election.
        <br>
        <br>
          Recent <a href="https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B03001&geo_ids=79500US3604112&primary_geo_id=79500US3604112">Census</a> data shows that 44% of Washington Heights residents are of Dominican descent.
        Political analyst Marlene Peralta argues that this shift towards the Republican Party among Latinos in the area is a result of
        the Democratic Party's perception of the Hispanic community.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Something I've observed for a long time is that the Democratic Party assumes Latinos are Democrats
        and will vote for them automatically. This has led them to neglect the Latino community," Peralta explained.
        Peralta also points out that, unlike the Democrats, the Republicans focused on emphasizing economic issues, a topic of great interest to the Hispanic population.
        <br>
        <br>
        According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Latinos make up 46.7% of the U.S. labor force.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Since the economy was the main issue in the Republican campaign, Trump was able to present himself
        as someone who paid attention to them while they felt neglected by the Democrats," Peralta added.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Political analyst also highlighted that the significant increase in Latino support for the Republican Party
        may have caught the Democratic sector of the city by surprise, as they have always treated the Hispanic population
        as a monolithic group rather than a diverse sector of society.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Many times they think all Latinos are immigrants and that this is the main concern for our community.
        However, not all Latinos are immigrants,” Peralta said.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the case of the Dominican population, Peralta emphasized that the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-dominican-republic-is-building-a-wall-to-keep-haitian-migrant-kids-out/">historical context linking
        the Dominican Republic with Haiti</a>, along with the relationship between the two Caribbean nations,
          may have made the Republican Party's <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1202966831">anti-Haitian immigration rhetoric</a>another factor
        that attracted Dominican voters in the city.
        <br>
        <br>
        “In the Dominican Republic, we have a huge issue with Haitians. Haitian migration is a topic with a lot of resonance,
        and after the comments against this population during the campaign, t
        his could have made Dominicans feel represented,” Peralta added.
        <br>
        <br>
        Although Vice President Kamala Harris received 1.6 million votes in the city,
        according to preliminary results from the New York City Board of Elections,
        Donald Trump emerged victorious with 312 electoral votes, after securing 99% of the registered electoral votes.
